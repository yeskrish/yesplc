- PLC is a programable logic controll 
- programmable controller is an industrial computer that has been ruggedized and adapted for the control of manufacturing processes, 
such as assembly lines, machines, robotic devices, or any activity that requires high reliability, ease of programming, and process fault diagnosis.
- what is plc used for? 
                PLC stands for Programmable Logic Controller. They are industrial computers used to control different electro-mechanical processes 
           for use in manufacturing, plants, or other automation environments. PLCs vary in size and form factors.
                
- What are the 4 main components of PLC?
                The Hardware components of a PLC are the Processor, the Power Supply, the Input/Output Modules, and a Programming Device.
                
- What are the 3 types of PLC?
                 PLC are divided into three types based on output namely Relay output, Transistor output, and Triac Output PLC. 
         The relay output type is best suited for both AC and DC output devices. 
         Transistor output type PLC uses switching operations and used inside microprocessors.
